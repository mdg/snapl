add client_server tests that use the mock connections

modify all code to use the new command/service interfaces
	remove action.h

combine server queue and the connection_listener class
	consider also combining blocking_client_queue and a connection class

separate client send and receive commands so they can be
	executed (and tested) separately

added templated action and client messages, that use the same
	request/response overrides

add support for handling the content portion of messages

add a logger class to allow turning debug messages on and off
	this should be log4c maybe?

see if it's possible to speed up the requests after polling

add a localhost-lockdown configuration to restrict all connections to those
	that are tunneled in through SSH

add a version handshake upon connections being made to allow
	shessiond to change while clients don't.

resolve blocking issues between mirrors.  export request can currently leave 2
	mirrors hanging on each other.  making thread queues for incoming
	& outgoing should resolve this and potentially speed up execution
	as well.

consider making rake build to use crake?

separate src code into server code and client code

password protection
encryption/SSL?
	might one or both of these be provided by SSH or SSH tunneling?

- scaling/optimizing
threading?  load testing suggests this may not be necessary initially
