consider merging request & response into a single command class

consider using crake to build snapl

add integration test framework for easily running client/server tests
	on customized protocols

add a request ID, sent from client to allow IDing remote requests on the server

add load testing

add a version handshake upon connections being made to allow
	shessiond to change while clients don't.

package snapl as a library
	separate src code into server code and client code

add support for handling the content portion of messages

add logging that allows turning debug messages on and off
	this should be log4c maybe?

see if it's possible to speed up the requests after polling

work with libevent?
	have to figure out licensing issues

add a localhost-lockdown configuration to restrict all connections to those
	that are tunneled in through SSH

password protection
encryption/SSL?
	might one or both of these be provided by SSH or SSH tunneling?

- scaling/optimizing
threading?  load testing suggests this may not be necessary initially
