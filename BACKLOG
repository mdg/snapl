fix testpp framework so it doesn't depend upon static initialization
	and uses ordered initialization instead.  some things fail
	when static initialization goes in the wrong order

fix config parsing to initialize with possible values before parsing
	it currently fails wrong when a non-int is requested as an int
	online printing of autogenerated config docs is also useful

add a logger class to allow turning debug messages on and off

create "protocol" code to be shared between client and server.
	provides request type ints and strings and other shared values

change status "request" to "renew"

modify protocol so create generates the sha1 session_id.
	replace the current session_id with an optional username parameter

add a localhost-lockdown configuration to restrict all connections to those
	that are tunneled in through SSH

see if it's possible to speed up the requests after polling

separate src code into server code and client code

consider creating a response object for the request_processor to write
back to, rather than writing directly to the connection

- mirrors aren't different than regular connections
mirror connections accepted

password protection
encryption/SSL?
	might one or both of these be provided by SSH or SSH tunneling?

- scaling/optimizing
threading?  load testing suggests this may not be necessary initially
