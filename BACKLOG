consider creating a response object for the request_processor to write
	back to, rather than writing directly to the connection

implement the admin protocol

modify renew request_processor to not allow updating the username

implement the mirror protocol

modify protocols to write an error if an unknown request_type is passed

add tests for new classes:
	protocol
	shession_control
	shession_protocol?

add a logger class to allow turning debug messages on and off
	this should probably be log4c

see if it's possible to speed up the requests after polling

add a localhost-lockdown configuration to restrict all connections to those
	that are tunneled in through SSH

separate src code into server code and client code

testpp assertion interface is a little flaky.  find a way to make it better

usage, configuration, connections and testpp could potentially be
	broken out into separate reusable libraries

online printing of autogenerated config docs

document shessiond/memcached difference
document shessiond

password protection
encryption/SSL?
	might one or both of these be provided by SSH or SSH tunneling?

- scaling/optimizing
threading?  load testing suggests this may not be necessary initially
