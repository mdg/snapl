	especially useful to make sure poll didn't slow down too much

fix config parsing to initialize with possible values before parsing
	it currently fails wrong when a non-int is requested as an int

fix Rakefile to support dependencies on headers

create "protocol" code to be shared between client and server.
	provides request type ints and strings and other shared values

change status "request" to "renew"

	replace the current session_id with an optional username parameter

consider creating a response object for the request_processor to write
back to, rather than writing directly to the connection

mirror protocol v1
mirror connections accepted
